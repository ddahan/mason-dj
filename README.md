## FAQ


> Why not use the front-end part of Django?

For a significant part of medium-sized projects, Django front-end abilities are unfortunately not enough to ensure a great UX/DX, compared to tools like React or Vue. [Htmx](https://htmx.org/) kind of fills the gap, but it currently lacks a proper integration with Django and a good developer experience. Besides, a Nuxt Mason Starter (cf. above) should be developed to have the front-end counterpart of this template.

> What if I (or other team members) are not using VS Code?

The whole DX part of this template is focused on VS Code so you would lose these specific features. Besides, if your team has different code editors, you should add configuration tools that work between multiple IDEs, like [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/).

> How do you pick the tools of this template?

- I try to pick tools that are suitable for **small to medium start-ups**. You never should start too big. I try to avoid complex concepts that can be more harmful than useful (kubernetes, micro-services)

- I try to favor **multi-usages tools** to have fewer tools in the end. For example, PostgreSQL can be used for sql **and** nosql, Redis can be used as a message broker **and** a cache mechanism, etc.

- I try to favor **open-source tools** which allow the user to self-host tool or use a paying SaaS (like highlight.io)

- When adding integrations, I try to pick the ones that are **broadly used** rather than the "best" ones.

- I try to **avoid in-progress work** that should change (That's why I prefer using Soeti to django-channels or anything async with Django).

> Why Django rather than fullstack JS?

If you're here, you might already be convinced, but let me share my thoughts regardless. While the appeal of full-stack JavaScript lies in using a single language, there's currently no equivalent to feature-rich frameworks like Django, Rails (Ruby), or Laravel (PHP) in the JavaScript world. Building a complex back-end becomes significantly more complicated, as you have to integrate multiple tools. Contrary to what they advertise, frameworks like Next.js are not "full-stack" as they don't offer essential backend building blocks like an ORM, authentication system, or validation.

Furthermore, Python is increasingly being used in projects for data analysis and machine learning, areas where JavaScript doesn't offer an equivalent. In such cases, the "single language" benefit loses its validity.
